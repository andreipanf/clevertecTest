##### Api now closed and the sample is not working. But you can see the logic.

The application receives from server the meta information for building dynamic registration form. The meta information get the number of lines, type of the values in line and name ​​of the form. Strings can contain text values​, numbers, or a list .

The user enters data into the form and it is sent to the server. The interaction occurs by REST with sending POST requests.
